# `cedh-proxy-generator`

I wanted a simple way to quickly generate playable proxies that can be sent to a card printing service. I am much too lazy to individually design each card, so this binary takes a card list, snags [PNGs from Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/blog/high-resolution-png-images-119), drops a huge `PLAYTEST` on the card art, and saves the images out. It doesn't handle things breaking well.

PRs welcome.
